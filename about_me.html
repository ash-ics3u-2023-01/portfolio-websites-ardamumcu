            <img src="arda.png" alt="Arda's Image" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
            <p>Hello, my name is Arda Mumcu. I am 16 years old and I go to All Saints Catholic High School. I can speak
                3 languages: English, French, and Turkish. I was also originally born in Istanbul, Turkey, and moved to
                Montreal when I was 3. I then lived there for 5 years, then went back to Turkey for 2 years, and I have
                been living in Ottawa ever since. I went to Georges Vanier elementary school. My favorite sports are
                soccer and basketball, and I used to actually play soccer until the age of 14. Soccer is by far my
                favorite sport, and I love watching it every weekend. I watch it with my friends, my brother, and my
                parents. My brother is actually a twin brother who is called Alp. Since we are twins, we do a lot of
                things together like watching movies, playing sports, and much more. In school, my favorite subject is
                probably math, which a lot of people would probably find weird, but I have always liked it since I was a
                kid. I also like hanging out with my friends and playing video games in my free time. In the future, I am
                not sure about what I would like to do yet, but computer science would definitely be in my
                consideration.</p>

        <div class="about_me">
            <img src="dad.png" alt="Dad" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
            <p>This is my dad. He was born on October 20th, 1969. He was born in Ankara, Turkey. He is a doctor in Turkey and still lives there. He delivers babies and loves his job. He always tries to visit us in Canada and always helps me. He is very good with technology and helps me whenever I need. He also enjoys watching soccer with me and also playing. Me and him played when he was the goalkeeper and I always took shots at him. He has always been there for me in life. He hopes to move to Canada soon as well as his job is more well paying there</p>
